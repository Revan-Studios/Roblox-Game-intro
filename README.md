# Roblox-Game-intro
Within this repository you will be told how to make a game intro for your Roblox game.


# How to make it work?
```
You first have to make a local script under replicated first and name the script "Intro".
After creating the local script copy and paste the Intro.lua script in the local script you have made. 
Afterwards create another local side script in the "intro" script and name it "Main". Then copy and paste the Main.lua script in your "Main" script in roblox studios. 
```

```
Your now done! All you have to do now is to create the visual GUI; to do that contact me Alcatraz#1073 for help or join https://discord.gg/uWfNXeYvjP ; for support!
